## üíä Medical & Product Recommendation System

### Medical Considerations
- **Disclaimer Requirements**: Clear statements that this is not medical advice
- **Flagging Serious Conditions**: System to identify potentially serious issues requiring medical attention
- **Medication Interactions**: Database of known interactions between skin conditions, medications, and ingredients

### Recommendation Engine
- **Rule-Based System**:
  - Explicit rules mapping conditions to ingredients/products
  - Can be reviewed by dermatologists
  - Easier to explain recommendations

- **ML-Based System**:
  - Learn from user feedback and outcomes
  - Can discover non-obvious relationships
  - Requires significant data to train effectively

- **Hybrid Approach**:
  - Start with rules-based system
  - Gradually incorporate ML as data accumulates

### Product Matching Logic
- Condition ‚Üí Required Ingredients ‚Üí Products containing ingredients
- Exclusion of contraindicated ingredients based on allergies/sensitivities
- Ranking system based on match quality, reviews, and effectiveness
- Consideration of product combinations for complete routines

---

## üîí Privacy & Compliance

### Regulatory Considerations
- **HIPAA** (if considered medical data in US)
- **GDPR** (for European users)
- **CCPA** (California Privacy)
- **FDA** regulations around medical claims
- **FTC** guidelines on marketing claims

### Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption for all data
- Secure image storage with access controls
- Anonymization options for research purposes
- Regular security audits
- Data retention and deletion policies

### Consent Management
- Granular consent options
- Clear explanation of data usage
- Option to revoke consent
- Data portability mechanisms
